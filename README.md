# Liquidmongo v0.1 Alpha
Hello, everyone! It's only an alpha version, if you want to help me, so please join! I've began to develop this library because
I don't know good proper libraries for migration data in MongoDB. (excluding Mongobee and a few others).
Concept:

Database has version. Each version has migration rules to this version and rollbacks.
